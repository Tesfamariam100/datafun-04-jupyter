# Project 4: Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
+  Name: Tesfamariam
+  Date: 2024-02-02

## Project Objectives:
The primary goal of Project 4 is to gain proficiency in the following areas:
+ Setting up a Jupyter Notebook environment
+  Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
+  Visualizing data using matplotlib and seaborn
+  Documenting insights and observations
 
## Deliverables

+  GitHub Repository: datafun-04-jupyter
+  Documentation: README.md
+  Notebook: Tesfamariam_eda.ipynb
  
## Getting started
### Here's what I did before starting the project:

+ I created a New GitHub Repository named datafun-04-jupyter to organize my work.
+ Next, I set up my Local Environment by cloning the repository to my local machine and creating a virtual environment.
+ I made sure to Install Dependencies by installing the required Python packages like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
+ Then, I launched Jupyter Notebook and created a new notebook file named yourname_eda.ipynb to begin my analysis.
### Here's what I did with the Iris dataset:

+ I loaded the Iris dataset into a DataFrame to start analyzing the data.
+ I inspected the first rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure.
+ I looked at the Initial Descriptive Statistics to get an overview of the data.
+ I visualized the Initial Data Distribution for Numerical Columns using histograms.
+ I explored the Initial Data Distribution for Categorical Columns by examining value counts.
+ I performed Initial Data Transformation and Feature Engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
+ Finally, I created Initial Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib to gain insights from the data.
